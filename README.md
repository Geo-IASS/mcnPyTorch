PyTorch model converter
---

A tool for converting [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) models into [MatConvNet](https://github.com/vlfeat/matconvnet). This is a work in progress.

###torchvision models

Some of the useful models available in the `torchvision.models` module 
have been converted into matconvnet and are available for download at the links
below:

### Converting your own models

The conversion script requires Python (with a PyTorch installed) and MATLAB.  Converting models between frameworks tends to be a non-trivial task, so it is likely
that modifications will be needed for unusual models.
